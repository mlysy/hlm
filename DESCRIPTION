Description: Provides efficient algorithms to compute the MLE of a heteroscedastic regression model, with linear mean and log-linear variance covariates.  An Expectation-Maximization algorithm is provided for right-censored responses, which are expected in the context of survival analysis for the corresponding heteroscedastic accelerated failure-time model of Wang et al (2019).
